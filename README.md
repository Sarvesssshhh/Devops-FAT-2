# 5 DevOps Concepts

### 1 Continuous Integration (CI)
- Developers frequently merge code into a shared repository.
- Automated testing ensures errors are detected early.
- Helps maintain code quality and prevents integration issues.

### 2 Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)
- Automatically deploy code changes to staging or production.
- Reduces manual work and speeds up software releases.
- Ensures every update is tested and ready to go live safely.

### 3 Containerization (Docker)
- Packages application and dependencies together to run anywhere.
- Ensures consistency between developer system and server.
- Makes apps lightweight and easy to scale.

### 4 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Infrastructure setup (servers, networks) is written as code (e.g., Terraform).
- Enables version control and automated provisioning.
- Faster, repeatable, and reduces human errors.

### 5 Monitoring & Logging
- Tracks application performance and resource usage.
- Helps detect issues before they impact users.
- Useful for troubleshooting and improving reliability.
